# ROT13 Passcode Transformer

## Description
The ROT13 Passcode Transformer is a C++ program that reads a ROT13 encoded passcode, transforms it using the ROT13 cipher, and outputs the result. Itâ€™s ideal for learning basic encryption techniques and C++ string manipulation.

## Features
- Reads passcode input from the user.
- Applies the ROT13 transformation.
- Handles uppercase, lowercase, and digit characters appropriately.
- Outputs the transformed passcode.

## Usage
To use the ROT13 Passcode Transformer, follow these steps:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter your ROT13 encoded passcode when prompted.
4. View the transformed passcode output.

## Code Overview
The program follows these main steps:
1. Reads input from the user.
2. Iterates over each character in the input.
3. Transforms the character using the ROT13 cipher.
4. Handles special cases for uppercase letters and digits.
5. Outputs the transformed passcode.

## Dependencies
The program uses standard C++ libraries, so no external dependencies are required.
