# 🚀 ROT13 Passcode Transformer

## 📖 Description
The **ROT13 Passcode Transformer** is a C++ program that reads a ROT13 encoded passcode, transforms it using the ROT13 cipher, and outputs the result. ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet, effectively encoding and decoding messages.
